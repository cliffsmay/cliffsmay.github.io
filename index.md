<h2> About ME <h2>

<p> My name is Cliff, I am 42 years old, and I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After working in the medical field as a histotechnologist for 17 years, I decided to return to school full time to pursue a degree in Computer Science. My goal is to begin a career as a software engineer. I enjoy writing, testing, and debugging code. I like to be challenged, and I work well in a collaborative team environment or on my own. I have a strong foundation in software engineering and programming, and I am experienced in several programming languages across multiple platforms. </p>
