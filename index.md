## About Me

My name is Cliff, I am 42 years old, and I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After working in the medical field as a histotechnologist for 17 years, I decided to 
return to school full time to pursue a degree in Computer Science. My goal is to begin a career as a software engineer. I enjoy writing, testing, and debugging code.
